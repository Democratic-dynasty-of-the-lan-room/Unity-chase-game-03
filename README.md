# Tag Chase game Collab

This is a revamped Git Repository for the *Almighty Game of Tag Chase*

> After 9 years of development, hopefully it will be worth the wait

## Scene overviews

In current version of this repository we have working MainMenu and a SampleScene. This is the code from the old repository with a slight Russian touch-up from YoursTrulyâ„¢

However, I feel it's a bit confusing to navigate, so my current attempts would be to recreate movement mechanics in a separate scene, trying to avoid GameObject assignment as much as confortably possible. Otherwise other developers won't understand how to use Scripts.

## Folder structure

Current repository contains Unity Project in a separate folder with an appropriate name of "Unity Project". Folder with the README.md file (this one you're reading right now) can be used to share other non-game assets. However, documentation and concept art is still advised to have inside **Assets/Docs** folder.

We have a following Asset folder structure at the moment:

![Folder_Structure](./Readme%20Images/Folder%20structure%20example%201.webp "Folder Structure")

## Question/Help?

![Meme](./Readme%20Images/meme.jpg "oh noes")

If you need any help with the repository or the game in general, please contact **@mrshurukan** at your local gamedev discord. ***No refunds!!!***
